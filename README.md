Hexweb is a web based hex mapper, designed for drawing large scale fantasy
(or other) maps, for regions the size of countries, continents or worlds.
Backed by a MySQL database, the idea is to allow very large, sparse maps,
so a single map can be used to include both detail of a country as well as
an outline of the entire world.

Hex tiles are bitmap based, but support for a vector layer to show roads,
rivers and coastlines is planned. Places such as towns and cities can also
be placed on their own layer, and are not tied to the hexagonal grid.

This is effectively version 2 of my Mapcraft application.
See http://mapcraft.glendale.org.uk/ for the details of the original.

The current status is "Get It Working", so it's neither pretty nor usable
for an end user. There is no documentation other than code comments, and
no installation or setup instructions.
